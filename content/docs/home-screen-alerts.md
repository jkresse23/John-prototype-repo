# Home Screen Alerts

## PART 1: PROBLEM DEFINITION

### 🤔 Problem

[Based on your notes: 1. Today, the Zip app home screen alerts feature at the top of the home screen is hard to use since users have to swipe through them one at a time and can't dismiss them.

2. We need a more modern UX, where customers get personalized messages at the top of their app home screen about upcoming repayments, issues with their account (confirm your email for example) and relevant deals. 

3. The UX should be seamless, accessible from the top of our mobile app home screen and ultimately result in high engagement.]

*To be completed: State the problem clearly and concisely in 1-2 sentences. Identify the specific customer segment affected. Focus on the user's pain point, not the solution.*

### Context

*To be completed: Provide background a new reader would need to understand the problem. Describe how the product currently works in this area. Include relevant facts, screenshots references, or user flows. Explain any technical or business context that matters.*

### 📊 Problem Validation

*To be completed: Include evidence that proves this is a real problem. Reference qualitative data: user interviews, support tickets, feedback. Reference quantitative data: metrics, conversion rates, usage data.*

### 🎯 Goals

*To be completed: Define clear, measurable success criteria. Tie goals to company OKRs or strategic pillars. Include target metrics (e.g., "Increase X by Y%"). Link to any business impact forecasting or sizing.*

## PART 2: SOLUTION

**Note:** Solutioning should happen AFTER Part 1 is complete. Design must be included in the conversation at this stage.

### 🎨 UX Flows or Wireframes

*To be completed: Describe the high-level user flow. Reference or describe wireframes/mockups. Show the happy path and key interactions. Include rough visual descriptions if no designs exist yet.*

### 🎯 Solution Options / Summary / MVP

*To be completed: Describe the proposed solution with structure and bullet points. Do NOT write formal requirements here—keep it conceptual. List the major chunks of work. Document alternative solutions that were considered and why they were rejected. Clearly define what is MVP vs. what can come later.*

### 🏆 Additional Phases / Breakdown

*To be completed: Break future work into logical phases. Phase 1 = MVP, Phase 2 = enhancements, etc. Keep it high-level—details go in requirements.*

### 👕 T-Shirt Estimate

*To be completed: Provide effort estimate: **Small**, **Medium**, **Large**, or **XL** (Small = days, Medium = 1-2 weeks, Large = 2-4 weeks, XL = 4+ weeks)*
